# Activity recommendation service: 
This is a project created using boredAPi which has been used to display actvity recommendations to the user.
- Using the API, the user is able to filter through results, such as through searching through categories, number of participants available and filter by difficulty.
- The user is first shown a menu with seven options for the user to choose from.
- Once the user has searched through ,and has stored, some results, they are given the option to view their previous search results (where they are printed to the terminal)
- Or they can view the results through the allActivities text file which they can save to their device.

### This application is best viewed through the computer terminal.
However, if viewing throuhg PyCharm, it is **strongly recommended** that the settings are changed so that the console emulates a terminal. To do this go to:

- Run (Located in the toolbar)
- Edit configurations
- Modify options
- Emulate terminal in output console
- Ok
- And then run as normal
